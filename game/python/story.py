story = """In a dimly lit, run-down bar, a young pilot sat, his emotions in turmoil. He clutched his newly acquired flight certificate tightly, a symbol of his dreams, yet also a reminder of his mounting debt and the lack of job offers that weighed heavily on his mind. The prospect of drowning his sorrows in alcohol seemed tempting.

As the hours passed, the pilot's inebriation grew, and his vision blurred. In his haze, he noticed a tall, shadowy figure lurking in a dark corner of the bar. The figure motioned for him to approach.

"Come closer... come closer..." the shady character beckoned.

His presence was both imposing and alluring, and after some contemplation, the young pilot slouched over, intrigued by what this enigmatic Stranger might have to offer.

"I have seen you suffer, and I want to offer you relief," the shady character spoke cryptically.

The pilot couldn't fathom what this mysterious person could provide. His most immediate need was a well-paying job that would utilize his newfound piloting skills.

"Something tells me you are in need of a way to make ends meet," the shady character continued. "Instead, I offer something much more. I happen to have a freight aircraft that is in dire need of a pilot."

The proposition seemed too good to be true, and the pilot's skepticism surfaced. Without a proper interview or background check, no one in their right mind would hire someone on the spot.

"You are correct," the pilot responded, his speech slurred from the alcohol. "I've just earned my flight certificate, and the crushing weight of my debt is suffocating. I need work right this moment, or I'm done for."

Though his words were slurred, the message seemed to have reached the menacing, tall figure, who offered a sinister smile.

"Perfect! Then we have a deal, don't we?" the shady character declared. "I will give you a chance to pay your debts by working my freighter to deliver cargo. Just remember, choices matter!"

As the Stranger chuckled, an eerie feeling washed over the room, and it seemed as though the very light around this person was distorted. The pilot felt a strong urge to close his eyes, and he drifted into a deep slumber.

When he awoke, he found himself at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, ready to board a freighter aircraft. Confusion filled his mind as he wondered how he had arrived here and why he was dressed appropriately for the occasion. His memory of the previous night was hazy, but at that moment, all that mattered was the job that awaited him.

familiar with. 

You call the Stranger and he explains they’re JETT-coins and not to worry as all airport services will accept them. 
Begrudgingly you decide to test that out as you’re not quite sure if you trust him yet. Surprisingly the transaction
