goodend = """    As the aircraft soared through the vast, open skies, I marveled at the incredible view from the 
    cockpit. The thrill of being in control of the freighter aircraft was like no other. The once ominous and foreboding 
    vessel had transformed into a magnificent, powerful flying machine.

    With the newfound control, I had the ability to navigate through the stormy skies and weave through turbulent winds with
    ease. The cargo I had agreed to transport for the devil had all been successfully delivered to its destination, and my 
    end of the deal had been fulfilled.

    As I landed the aircraft safely at the designated airport, the devil himself appeared before me, his grin no longer 
    malicious but rather a nod of approval. He had kept his part of the bargain and allowed me to experience the 
    exhilaration of piloting his freighter. With a subtle acknowledgment, he disappeared into the shadows. I had paid my 
    dues, and now I was free to continue my journey as a skilled pilot with a story to tell, forever cherishing the memories 
    of my time in the skies.

    THE END"""

neutralend = """    As you bring the freighter to a steady descent, the ground gradually approaches. You navigate through 
    the thick, ominous clouds, and the runway comes into view. The landing gear lowers, and you make a smooth touchdown, 
    guided by an otherworldly, eerie glow. The cargo aircraft comes to a stop, and you shut down the engines. You've 
    completed your mission, but there are no wild celebrations or dramatic events. It's just another day in the life of a 
    pilot bound by a sinister pact.

    Your performance was adequate, and the cargo is safely delivered to its destination. The loading crew works efficiently, 
    and the ground crew scurries away as if they're afraid of making eye contact with you. You exit the cockpit and head 
    back to the cargo area. As you step onto the airstrip, the sun begins to set, casting an eerie, blood-red hue across the 
    airport.

    Your journey was uneventful, and you've fulfilled your part of the dire deal. You may not have set any records or 
    encountered any overtly malevolent forces, but you did your job competently. As you walk away from the aircraft, you 
    reflect on the peculiar, otherworldly nature of your existence. Sometimes, the best outcome is merely fulfilling the 
    obligations of your contract.

    THE END"""

badend = """    In the dingy cabin of the aircraft, the realization hit me like a punch in the gut. The Stranger who had 
    struck a sinister deal with me was no ordinary person, he was the embodiment of evil itself, the devil. His malevolent 
    grin sent shivers down my spine as he revealed his true identity, and I understood the grave mistake I had made.

    As the flight continued, the atmosphere grew increasingly oppressive, and a sense of impending doom hung in the air. I 
    had agreed to a favor that I thought was benign, but it had taken a nightmarish turn. Desperation welled up inside me as 
    I realized the gravity of my actions, but it was too late.

    In the final moments of the flight, as the aircraft reached its cruising altitude, the devil claimed what he was owed, 
    which was my soul. It was as if all light and hope were extinguished in an instant, replaced by a profound darkness that 
    engulfed me. I could feel the essence of my being forcibly torn from me, and my consciousness began to fade.

    There was no escape from this horrifying fate. I had foolishly struck a bargain that sealed my destiny, leaving me in a 
    state of eternal torment and servitude.

    THE END"""
